      If your server signs users in with an external identity provider (OIDC), Mealie now requires that provider to confirm the user's email address before allowing the login.

      This prevents an unverified, self-asserted email address from being used to match (and sign in) to an existing Mealie account.

          <strong>
            breaking change
          </strong>
          for identity providers that do not emit the
          <code>
            email_verified
          </code>
          claim. Those logins now fail, and
          <code>
            [OIDC] email_verified claim is missing or false
          </code>
          is written to the server logs.
