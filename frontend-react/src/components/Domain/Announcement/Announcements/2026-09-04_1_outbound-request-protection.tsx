    <p>
      Mealie now checks where its own outgoing requests are going. Anything the server fetches on your behalf, such as importing a recipe from a URL, downloading a recipe image, sending a webhook, or running a recipe action, is only allowed to reach addresses on the public internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      This protects your network: without it, someone could use one of those features to make your Mealie server reach devices it can see but they can't.

        <hr className="mt-2 mb-4" />
        <p>
          Webhooks and recipe actions were not checked before, and the checks on recipe imports were narrower than they are now. If any of these pointed at something on your own network, they will stop working after this update.

            Requests are now refused when the target resolves to:

          <ul className="ml-6">

              <code>
                100.64.0.0/10
              </code>
              . This one is worth noting, because it is the range
              <strong>
                Tailscale
              </strong>
              uses

            <li>

          A hostname is also refused if
          <em>
            any
          </em>
          of the addresses it resolves to is non-public, not just the first one. Split-horizon DNS setups are the usual reason this bites.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you need a target on your own network to keep working, allow it explicitly with
          <code>
            HTTP_ALLOW_LIST
          </code>
          , which accepts hostnames or CIDRs. To keep a Tailscale host reachable, for example:
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>
            HTTP_ALLOW_LIST=100.64.0.0/10
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          There is also
          <code>
            HTTP_DISALLOW_LIST
          </code>
          for blocking targets that would otherwise be allowed, including public ones. It takes precedence over the allow list.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notifiers are unaffected. They send through the Apprise library rather than Mealie's own HTTP client, so they are not covered by these checks.
