      Importing recipes from a URL is now more reliable. Mealie does a better job of looking like a real browser, rotates between several browser signatures, and retries more intelligently when a site pushes back. This works out of the box, with no configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some sites sit behind bot protection (such as Cloudflare) that blocks requests made by a server, no matter how they're made. For those, Mealie can now optionally fall back to two extra layers.
    </p>
    <div className="mb-2">
      <ul className="ml-6">
        <li>
          <strong>
            Proxy support
          </strong>
          , which routes recipe and image requests through a proxy. This helps with sites that block your server's IP address.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            FlareSolverr support
          </strong>
          , which hands the page to a real headless browser as a last resort. This helps with challenges that Mealie can't get past on its own.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    {(user?.admin) ? (
      <div>
        <hr className="mt-2 mb-4" />
        <p>
          Both are optional and off by default, so nothing changes unless you configure them. Mealie escalates only as far as it needs to for each import: a direct fetch first, then the proxy (if set), then FlareSolverr (if set, and only when the page is still blocked).
        </p>
        <p>
          Both are enabled with environment variables. Mealie does not ship or manage either one. You supply the proxy, and host FlareSolverr yourself (it runs nicely as a sidecar container). See the configuration docs for the settings, setup details, and an example compose file:
          <br />
          <Button className="mt-2" color="primary" href="https://docs.mealie.io/documentation/getting-started/installation/backend-config/#recipe-scraper" target="_blank">
            Backend Configuration
          </Button>
        </p>
      </div>
    ) : (
      <div>
        <p>
          If a recipe URL still refuses to import, let your server admin know. They can enable these extra options on the server.
        </p>
      </div>
    )}
  </div>
    </>
